# Book-Wormz - Project 3

BookWormz is a Python terminal application which runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

It is a system where a user can signup, login, and add their favourite books. The user can also perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these books as they wish.

The following diagram gives an outline of the users flow of actions through the application and the different choices of actions that can be undertaken.
