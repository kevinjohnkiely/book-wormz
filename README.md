# Book-Wormz - Project 3

This application is a command line interface built using Python that allows a user to register and account and add their list of favourite books, or books they wish to read. Once logged in to the system they can carry out full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their personal list of books, editing or deleting items as they wish.
